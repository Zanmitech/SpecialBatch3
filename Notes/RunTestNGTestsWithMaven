In order to Run TestNG tests in suite level like from testng.xml,
We need Surefire plugin example;

  <build>
	  <plugins>
	      <plugin>
	        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
	        <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
	        <version>2.21.0</version>
	        <configuration>
	          <suiteXmlFiles>
	            <suiteXmlFile>testng.xml</suiteXmlFile>
	          </suiteXmlFiles>
	        </configuration>
	      </plugin>
	      
	      
		</plugins>
	</build>
	
	
After this we cant run the tests you are getting below error  "No compiler is provided in this environment. Perhaps you are running on a JRE rather than a JDK?"
To fix this we need to do 2 things as below

1. we need to add Maven-Compiler 


	<plugin>
          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
          <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>3.7.0</version>
          <configuration>
            <!-- put your configurations here -->
          </configuration>
     </plugin>
     
     
 2. Still if it is throwing error "no compiler is provided in this environment" then point ur installed JRE to JDk as below:
 
 If you are running Maven from your IDE you must check that your environment is using a JDK rather than a JRE. Below how to perform the check:

	--> Open your Eclipse, click on Windows -> Preferences -> Java -> Installed JREs
	--> Verify that the checked JRE refers to a JDK : Select the checked JRE and click Editâ€¦ and change the path to the JDK home
	--> Apply and click ok
	
	Note: Refer this url --> http://roufid.com/no-compiler-is-provided-in-this-environment/
	
3. After fixing this problem then you navigate untill pom.xml is present in project path in cmd then trigger maven commands like mvn clean mvn compile mvn run etc..
